Write a 500-word Medium post on analyzing the structure of a Web-based network. 
Relevant networks or graphs include the Web graph (e.g., edges between domains 
or edges between articles in a single web site) or online social networks. 
In your analysis, define what it means for a node to be "important" and describe 
how you might find such a node in the graph.


Identify a non-obvious insight you want to extract from your data, describing what 
decision(s) this insight might inform.

Describe the source of your network data. Where did it come from, and how did you 
collect it?

Define what nodes and edges in your network represent and how you built 
this graph from your data.

Define "importance" in your graph and identify a set of at least three important nodes.

Describe any software you used to facilitate your network analysis 
(e.g., NetworkX, NodeXL, or similar).

Describe how you cleaned up this data, common bugs you think others might 
encounter, and how you fixed them, etc.

Include figures or tables summarizing your findings.

Conclude with a discussion of the limitations of your analysis. 
Whatâ€™s missing? How might it be biased?

Include a link to your GitHub repository where you have code for this analysis.
