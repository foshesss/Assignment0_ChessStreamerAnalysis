Identify a non-obvious insight you want to extract from your data, describing what decision(s) 
this insight might inform.
- Finding chess streamer ratings that are recognized by chess.com 
- This type of knowledge might be helpful to somebody who wants to be an official 
partnered streamer for chess.com

Perform some exploratory data analysis that helps inform the decision you posed in your 
introduction. 
- It seems that players should shoot to be ~2000 or greater than rating. However, there are chess streamers
that do not fall into this range. Some were as low as 150 rating.

Describe the data that could answer this question, where it lives, and why it's relevant.
- Chess.com has an API of chess streamers and other endpoints to extract player rating across
all types of chess gamemodes.

Explain how you collected the data, e.g., libraries like requests, BeautifulSoup, tweepy, 
praw, etc. or from a data archive. 
- 'requests' library to touch chess.com endpoints.
- 'matplotlib.pyplot' for plotting data.
- 'numpy' for calculating useful statistics about player ratings.

Conclude with a discussion of the limitations of your analysis. 
After glancing through the streamers, it seems that some were alt accounts of pro chess streamers.
This could skew the data towards the average being a higher rating.

Whatâ€™s missing? How might it be biased?
There are other factors that may determine chess.com's choice in streamers:
- Streamer popularity before applying to become an official streamer.
- How family friendly a streamer is.
